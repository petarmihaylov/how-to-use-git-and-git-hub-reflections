Q1: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository is great for many reasons. If you have a remore repository, and your computer fails
you will be able to recover your work. If you want to share your repository with other people, it would be more
practical to store it on a remote server that is available 24/7 rather than having to keep your computer on all
the time in case someone wants to clone your repository. Lastly, if you are working on a project from more than
one computer, it would be easier to keep everything synced in a remote repository.
