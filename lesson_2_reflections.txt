Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, Git creates some metadata for the repository
and stores that data in a hidded .git folder withing the main folder of the
repository. In essense, it prepares the directory tree and setting everything up
to track changes. The reason why we initialize the repository is so that we can
tell git that this is supposed to be a repository and Git needs to track changes
as opposed to it being a regular directlry.

Q2: How is the staging area different than from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?h

The staging area is an intermediatry between the working directory and the
repository. The staging area keeps track of all the files that are being added
to the repository and also tracks any changes to the repository for filed that
are already being tacked. 

The staging area gives us the advantage of keeping files in the repository that
we want to track and keep the files we don't need to track together. This might 
be useful when we have external resources for files that we need for our
project to work, but we don't necessariry have control over their contant.
Additonally, we might have some "lorem ipsum" type data that we just use for
testing of our software, but that it is complletely random and does not need to
be tracked.
